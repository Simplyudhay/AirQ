## 🌍 What Is This?

Imagine cracking open a map before breakfast and spotting tomorrow’s **ozone (O₃)** and **nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)** levels. Not just numbers—**color-coded, interactive, forecasted**, and explained with help from an AI buddy.

This isn’t just *another AQI app*.
It’s a **time machine for the atmosphere.**
